As such, it is recommended to submit all work in a timely manner based on official guidelines; if uncertain about any aspect regarding extensions post due dates as stated or needed beforehand beyond explicit permissions that can't be provided here due to being outdated information within this context, reaching out directly for the most current policies and decisions through appropriate communication channels with your instructors is advisable.\""
